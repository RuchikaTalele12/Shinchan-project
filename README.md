# 🎈 Shinchan Balloon Popper

A fun Python arcade game built using Pygame where **Shinchan throws darts** to pop **floating balloons**! Score points by hitting balloons and avoid missing too many — 5 misses and it's game over.

---

## 🕹️ Features

- 🎯 Shinchan automatically throws darts.
- 🎈 Balloons float up randomly from the bottom.
- 💥 Score increases on every balloon popped.
- 💾 High score is saved across games (`high_score.txt`).
- 😵 5 missed balloons = Game Over.
